description: PxIgnis ships with bundled Lua libraries that can be loaded via require().
---

PxIgnis includes several Lua libraries in `config/pxrp/`. Load them with `require()`:

```lua
local format = require "format"
local simple = require "simple"
local chestgui = require "chestgui"
```

## Available Libraries

| Library | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [format](/libraries/format) | F-string-like text templating |
| [simple](/libraries/simple) | Concise command registration with built-in formatting |
| [chestgui](/libraries/chestgui) | Chest-based GUI creation |

## Loading from Subdirectories

Files in subdirectories of `config/pxrp/` can be loaded using dot notation:

```lua
local utils = require "libs.utils"
```

This resolves to `config/pxrp/libs/utils.lua`.

## package.path

The Lua `package.path` is set to:

```
config/pxrp/?.lua;config/pxrp/?/init.lua;?.lua
```
